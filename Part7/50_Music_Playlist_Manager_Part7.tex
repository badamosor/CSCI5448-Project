\textbf{Vision:} Provide a platform for building and sharing music playlists.
\section{Project Description}
Sharing playlists of music between a large group of people can be difficult when
everyone doesn't listen to music through the same service. This will allow people to create
playlists in a generic format that can then be integrated into the userâ€™s service of choice. This allows people to share their playlists with their friends who can then export it into the streaming service of their choice.

\section{Class Diagrams}

	\caption{Class Diagram from Part 2}
	\label{fig:classDiagPart2}
\end{figure}
Our class diagram changed significantly between Part 2 and now. The fundamental reason for this is we started working with the Django framework after we finished the Part 2. Since Django had a lot of built of functionality for accessing data from a database and then displaying that data, we incorporated our ideas from Part 2 into this framework. We also updated the class diagram to reflect the design patterns we had implemented. 

The class diagram in \Cref{fig:classDiagCompleted} is entirely completed. The green classes are classes that are implemented by Django so there are no details included. The blue classes represent a larger set of classes that didn't fit in this diagram. They can be seen in detail in \Cref{fig:classDiagExport} and \Cref{fig:classDiagSearch} respectively.

\section{Design Patterns}

	\label{fig:classDiagExportPattern}
\end{figure}
We used the Strategy pattern as a way to choose which external music we wanted to export to and use the appropriate algorithm for it. This was combined with the Facade pattern to handle the complexities of exporting a playlist. This allowed us to make a nice interface that didn't care about all the nitty-gritty details of exporting. This pattern would be even more important if we had worked with the actual music service API's where things would have been even more complicated.
