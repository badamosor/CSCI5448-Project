\textbf{Vision:} Provide a platform for building and sharing music playlists.
\section{Project Description}
Sharing playlists of music between a large group of people can be difficult when
everyone doesn't listen to music through the same service. This will allow people to create
playlists in a generic format that can then be integrated into the userâ€™s service of choice. This allows people to share their playlists with their friends who can then export it into the streaming service of their choice.

Our class diagram changed significantly between Part 2 and now. The fundamental reason for this is we started working with the Django framework after we finished the Part 2
